# Ment(or/ee)
One of the significant challenges facing college students aspiring to break into their respective industry today is the necessity to meaningfully network with industry professionals. Ment(or/ee) aims to assist students in overcoming this challenge by sophisticatedly matching them with professionals willing to mentor students on their journey. Simply create a profile stating your goals—whether for long-term guidance, resume reviews, mock interviews, or just a simple coffee chat—and you can establish a meaningful professional connection with Ment(or/ee).

  * View/edit your own profile
* Matching algorithm that takes user preferences
  * Define preferences in the type of mentorship, career, field, location, and education that the user is looking for in a mentor or mentee
  * Algorithm considers attributes, each with different weight, in the matching process before returning a percentage match
* Search and view other user’s profiles, leave reviews/recommendations
  * Reviews and recommendations can be public or anonymous
* Start a chat with other users 
* Connect to zoom to easily schedule virtual chats impromptu or as recurring meetings
  * Connect to each other’s own zoom account
  * If preferred or possible, embed the zoom meeting into the client itself

## Stretch Goals

* Technical Resume builder augmented by generative AI (likely RAG with GPT)
  * Generate suggestions to the document with grammar/diction
  * Upload pre existing document to scan if the document is ATS friendly
* Connect to other social platform profiles (LinkedIn / GitHub)
  * Use additional info to autofill profile
  * Verify profile with work / school email or other credentials
  * LinkedIn OAuth (if team is able to integrate Zoom, this should follow just as easily, time permitting)
* Google Maps Integration
  * Little map included on profile to mark which city a user is based out of
  * Fun little thing :)
